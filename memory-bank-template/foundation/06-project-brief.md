## Estimation Methodology

This project uses **Story Point Estimation** for all development tasks. Story points represent the relative effort, complexity, and risk of user stories or tasks.

### Story Point Scale
- **1 Point**: Very simple task, minimal complexity, well understood
- **2 Points**: Simple task with minor complexity or unknowns
- **3 Points**: Moderate task with some complexity or dependencies
- **5 Points**: Complex task with multiple components or significant unknowns
- **8 Points**: Very complex task requiring substantial research or coordination
- **13 Points**: Extremely complex task that should be broken down further

### Estimation Guidelines
- **Always provide story point estimates** for all tickets and tasks
- Use Planning Poker or similar collaborative estimation techniques
- Consider complexity, effort, uncertainty, and risk when estimating
- Break down tasks larger than 8 points into smaller stories
- Re-estimate if significant scope changes occur during implementation
- Track actual vs. estimated effort to improve future estimates

### Estimation Factors
When estimating story points, consider:
- **Technical Complexity**: Algorithm complexity, integration challenges
- **Effort Required**: Development time, testing time, documentation
- **Uncertainty/Risk**: Unknown requirements, new technology, dependencies
- **Scope**: Number of components affected, breadth of changes
