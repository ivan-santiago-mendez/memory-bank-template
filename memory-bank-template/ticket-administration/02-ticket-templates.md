# Ticket Templates

This document provides standardized templates for creating tickets with proper story point estimation.

## User Story Template

```
**Title**: Should be concise and user-focused ("As a [type of user], I want to [action] or action-oriented for tasks (eg: "Implement X Feature") so that [*we can achieve XYZ]

**Description**:
Explain the goal/scope of this specific task within the larger context 

**Technical Notes**:
- Add details about where and what we are going to change in the current codebase
- Also add any architectural decisions or major design patterns if relevant to this specific item.
- Add component impacted details 
- Add API level details 

**Acceptance Criteria**:
I'll know this is done whenâ€¦..
- Add AC in the form of checklist 
    - [ ] Criterion 1
    - [ ] Criterion 2
    - [ ] Criterion 3
- Add clear, testable statements that define when the story is "done"

**Testing & Verification**:
- Clearly define how the story will be tested, distinguishing between different levels:
- Unit Tests: What areas require new or updated unit tests? 
- Integration Tests: What integration tests to be added to test the functionality
- Manual Testing: Specific scenarios that need manual verification

**Story Points**: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
**Estimation Rationale**:

```

## Technical Task Template

```

**Type**: [Refactoring/Infrastructure/Tech Debt/Research]

**Description**:
[Detailed technical requirements and context]

**Technical Requirements**:
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

**Story Points**: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
**Estimation Rationale**:
- Technical complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Research required: [None/Some/Extensive]
- Impact scope: [Limited/Moderate/Wide]
- Testing complexity: [Simple/Moderate/Complex]

**Risks and Mitigation**:
- Risk 1: [Description and mitigation]
- Risk 2: [Description and mitigation]

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Technical implementation complete
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
```

## Epic Template

```
**Title**: [High-level feature or initiative]

**Strategic Goal**:
[How this epic aligns with business objectives]

**Description**:
[Comprehensive description of the epic scope]

**User Stories**:
- [ ] Story 1 ([X] points)
- [ ] Story 2 ([X] points)
- [ ] Story 3 ([X] points)

**Total Story Points**: [Sum of all stories]

**Success Metrics**:
- Metric 1: [Target value]
- Metric 2: [Target value]

**Dependencies**:
- Dependency 1
- Dependency 2

**Timeline**: [Expected duration based on story points and team velocity]

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] All user stories completed
- [ ] Success metrics achieved
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed
- [ ] Production deployment successful
```

## Estimation Guidelines for Templates

### Quick Estimation Reference
- **1-2 Points**: Small changes, bug fixes, simple features
- **3-5 Points**: Medium features, moderate complexity
- **8 Points**: Large features, high complexity
- **13+ Points**: Should be broken down into smaller stories

### Estimation Factors to Consider
1. **Complexity**: Algorithm complexity, integration challenges
2. **Effort**: Development time, testing time, documentation
3. **Uncertainty**: Unknown requirements, new technology
4. **Dependencies**: External systems, team dependencies
5. **Risk**: Potential for scope creep, technical challenges

### Best Practices
- Always include estimation rationale
- Re-estimate if scope changes during implementation
- Use Planning Poker or similar collaborative techniques
- Track actual vs. estimated for continuous improvement
- Break down stories larger than 8 points

## Ticket Comment Guidelines

When providing updates or summaries for tickets, follow these guidelines unless explicitly requested otherwise:

### Executive Summary Focus
- **Write for decision-makers**: Focus on business impact and outcomes, not technical implementation details
- **High-level language**: Use business-friendly terminology that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- **Key results first**: Lead with what was achieved, not how it was achieved
- **Avoid technical jargon**: Save detailed technical explanations for technical documentation or when specifically requested

### Complexity Metrics Over Time Estimates
- **Use complexity indicators**: Report using complexity metrics (Low/Medium/High or story points)
- **Never include time estimates**: Do not mention hours, days, or weeks in summary comments
- **Focus on scope**: Describe the scope of work completed in terms of business value
- **Reference story points**: Use the ticket's assigned story points as the complexity reference

### No Internal Documentation References
- **Avoid memory bank references**: Never mention memory bank, internal documentation, or AI assistant context in ticket comments
- **External-facing language**: Write as if the comment is public-facing and self-contained
- **Focus on deliverables**: Describe what was delivered, not where information was sourced from
- **Professional communication**: Keep comments professional and stakeholder-appropriate

### Example Comment Formats

**Good Executive Summary:**
```
Completed user authentication enhancement. System now supports multi-factor authentication, improving security posture. Complexity: Medium (5 points). All acceptance criteria met.
```

**Avoid (Too Technical):**
```
Implemented JWT token refresh mechanism with Redis caching layer. Modified AuthService.ts to include token rotation logic with 15-minute expiration windows. Added bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds of 10. Estimated 2 days of work completed.
```

### When to Provide Technical Details
Only include technical implementation details when:
- User explicitly requests detailed technical explanation
- Creating technical documentation or handoff notes
- Discussing technical blockers or challenges with the development team
- Documenting architectural decisions for future reference
