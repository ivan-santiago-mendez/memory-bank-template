# Ticket Administration Knowledge Base

This directory contains all knowledge, workflows, templates, and best practices for ticket management and story point estimation.

## Overview

All development work in this project follows a ticket-driven approach with mandatory story point estimation. Every task, feature, or bug fix must be associated with a properly estimated ticket.

## Core Principles

- **Every task requires a ticket** with story point estimation
- **Story points are relative estimates** of effort, complexity, and risk
- **Collaborative estimation** improves accuracy and team alignment
- **Continuous improvement** through retrospectives and velocity tracking

## Directory Contents

### [ticket-templates.md](ticket-templates.md)
Standardized templates for different types of tickets:
- User Stories with acceptance criteria
- Bug Reports with reproduction steps
- Technical Tasks with requirements
- Epics with success metrics

All templates include story point estimation sections and rationale.

### [best-practices.md](best-practices.md)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Story point estimation methodology
- Planning Poker processes
- Ticket writing guidelines
- Definition of Done checklists
- Velocity tracking and planning
- Continuous improvement practices

### [workflows.md](workflows.md)
Standard ticket lifecycle workflows:
- Ticket creation and estimation process
- Review and approval workflows
- Development and testing phases
- Deployment and closure procedures

### [roles-and-permissions.md](roles-and-permissions.md)
Team roles and responsibilities:
- Product Owner: Requirements and priorities
- Scrum Master: Process facilitation
- Development Team: Estimation and implementation
- QA Team: Testing and validation

## Quick Reference

### Story Point Scale
- **1**: Very simple, well understood (few hours)
- **2**: Simple with minor complexity (half day)
- **3**: Moderate complexity (1 day)
- **5**: Complex with unknowns (2-3 days)
- **8**: Very complex (3+ days)
- **13**: Too large - break down further

### Estimation Factors
Consider these when estimating:
- **Complexity**: Technical difficulty
- **Effort**: Development and testing time
- **Uncertainty**: Unknown requirements or approaches
- **Dependencies**: External systems or teams
- **Risk**: Potential complications

## Usage Guidelines

### For Product Owners
- Write clear user stories with business value
- Participate in estimation sessions for clarification
- Prioritize backlog based on value and effort
- Accept completed work using Definition of Done

### For Development Team
- Participate actively in estimation sessions
- Break down large stories (8+ points) into smaller ones
- Update story status throughout development
- Track actual vs. estimated effort for improvement

### For Scrum Masters
- Facilitate Planning Poker sessions
- Track team velocity and estimation accuracy
- Help resolve blockers and dependencies
- Conduct retrospectives on estimation practices

## Integration with Memory Bank

This ticket administration system integrates with the broader memory bank strategy:
- All tickets reference relevant foundation documents
- Active work is tracked in `context/activeContext.md`
- Progress updates are maintained in `context/progress.md`
- Architectural decisions are documented in `context/systemPatterns.md`

## Getting Started

1. **Read** [best-practices.md](best-practices.md) for methodology overview
2. **Use** [ticket-templates.md](ticket-templates.md) for consistent formatting
3. **Follow** [workflows.md](workflows.md) for process compliance
4. **Reference** [roles-and-permissions.md](roles-and-permissions.md) for responsibilities
