# Best Practices for Ticket Management and Story Point Estimation

This document outlines best practices for creating, managing, and estimating tickets using story points.

## Story Point Estimation Best Practices

### Core Principles

1. **Relative Estimation**: Story points represent relative effort, not absolute time
2. **Team Consistency**: Use the same baseline across the entire team
3. **Include All Work**: Factor in development, testing, documentation, and deployment
4. **Collaborative Estimation**: Use team input to improve accuracy

### Estimation Process

#### 1. Planning Poker Sessions
- **Facilitator**: Product Owner or Scrum Master
- **Participants**: Entire development team
- **Process**:
  1. Read story aloud
  2. Discuss questions and clarifications
  3. Each team member selects estimate privately
  4. Reveal estimates simultaneously
  5. Discuss differences, especially highest and lowest estimates
  6. Re-estimate until consensus is reached

#### 2. Estimation Factors Matrix

| Factor | 1-2 Points | 3-5 Points | 8+ Points |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Complexity** | Well-understood, straightforward | Some complexity, familiar patterns | High complexity, new patterns |
| **Effort** | Few hours to 1 day | 1-3 days | 3+ days |
| **Uncertainty** | Clear requirements | Some unknowns | Many unknowns |
| **Dependencies** | No external dependencies | Few dependencies | Multiple dependencies |
| **Risk** | Low risk of issues | Moderate risk | High risk of complications |

### Estimation Guidelines by Story Type

#### User Stories
- Focus on business value and user impact
- Consider UI/UX complexity
- Include backend and frontend work
- Factor in cross-browser testing

#### Bug Fixes
- **1-2 Points**: Simple UI fixes, typos, minor logic errors
- **3-5 Points**: Moderate bugs requiring investigation
- **8+ Points**: Complex bugs affecting multiple components

#### Technical Tasks
- **Refactoring**: Base on scope and risk
- **Infrastructure**: Consider setup, testing, and documentation
- **Research Spikes**: Time-box and estimate investigation effort
- **Technical Debt**: Factor in testing and validation needs

### Common Estimation Mistakes

#### Avoid These Pitfalls
- **Anchoring**: Being influenced by first estimate given
- **Optimism Bias**: Underestimating due to best-case thinking
- **Complexity Creep**: Not accounting for edge cases
- **Integration Oversight**: Forgetting about system integration effort
- **Testing Neglect**: Not including testing time in estimates

#### Red Flags for Re-estimation
- Story grows during implementation
- New dependencies are discovered
- Technical approach changes significantly
- Requirements become unclear during development

## Ticket Writing Best Practices

### User Story Format
```
As a [role]
I want [goal/desire]
So that [benefit/value]
```

#### Good Example
```
As a customer
I want to save items to a wishlist
So that I can easily find and purchase them later
```

#### Poor Example
```
As a user
I want a button
So that I can click it
```

### Acceptance Criteria Guidelines

#### Use GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Format
```
GIVEN [initial context]
WHEN [action is performed]
THEN [expected outcome]
```

#### Example
```
GIVEN I am logged in as a customer
WHEN I click the "Add to Wishlist" button on a product
THEN the product is added to my wishlist and I see a confirmation message
```

### Definition of Done Checklist

#### Standard DoD Items
- [ ] Code implemented following coding standards
- [ ] Unit tests written with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product Owner approval received

#### Additional DoD for Different Story Types

**UI Stories**
- [ ] Responsive design verified
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines followed
- [ ] Design review approved

**API Stories**

- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

**Database Stories**
- [ ] Migration scripts tested
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Data validation rules implemented

## Velocity and Planning

### Calculating Team Velocity
- **Sprint Velocity**: Total story points completed in a sprint
- **Rolling Average**: Average velocity over last 3-5 sprints
- **Planning Capacity**: Use 80% of average velocity for sprint planning

### Velocity Tracking
- Track completed vs. committed story points
- Monitor velocity trends over time
- Adjust estimates based on historical accuracy
- Consider team changes and external factors

### Sprint Planning Guidelines
- Don't exceed 120% of average velocity
- Leave buffer for urgent bugs and support
- Consider team availability and holidays
- Balance story sizes within sprints

## Continuous Improvement

### Retrospective Focus Areas
- **Estimation Accuracy**: Compare actual vs. estimated effort
- **Story Breaking**: Identify patterns in oversized stories
- **Bottlenecks**: Find common causes of story delays
- **Team Alignment**: Ensure consistent understanding of story points

### Metrics to Track
- **Estimation Variance**: Difference between estimated and actual completion
- **Story Cycle Time**: Time from start to completion
- **Throughput**: Number of stories completed per sprint
- **Defect Rate**: Bugs per story point delivered

### Improvement Actions
- Regular estimation calibration sessions
- Story point baseline refinement
- Process adjustments based on retrospectives
- Team training on estimation techniques
