# Ticket Workflows and Lifecycle Management

This document defines the standard workflows for ticket creation, estimation, development, and closure with integrated story point estimation.

## Ticket Lifecycle Overview

```
[Backlog] → [Estimated] → [Sprint Ready] → [In Progress] → [Review] → [Testing] → [Done]
```

## Detailed Workflow Stages

### 1. Backlog Creation
**Responsible**: Product Owner, Stakeholders
**Duration**: Ongoing

**Activities**:
- Create initial ticket using appropriate template
- Define business value and requirements
- Add to product backlog
- Set initial priority (High/Medium/Low)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Clear problem statement or feature request
- Business justification documented
- High-level requirements defined

**Exit Criteria**:
- Ticket created with proper template
- Added to backlog for estimation
- Initial priority assigned

### 2. Estimation and Refinement
**Responsible**: Development Team, Product Owner
**Duration**: During backlog refinement sessions

**Activities**:
- Review ticket details and requirements
- Conduct Planning Poker estimation session
- Break down large stories (8+ points)
- Refine acceptance criteria
- Identify dependencies and risks

**Entry Criteria**:
- Ticket exists in backlog
- Requirements are sufficiently detailed
- Product Owner available for questions

**Exit Criteria**:
- Story points assigned with rationale
- Acceptance criteria finalized
- Dependencies identified
- Story sized appropriately (≤8 points)

#### Estimation Session Process
1. **Preparation** (5 minutes)
   - Review ticket requirements
   - Clarify questions with Product Owner
   - Identify technical constraints

2. **Individual Estimation** (2 minutes)
   - Each team member selects estimate privately
   - Consider complexity, effort, uncertainty, risk

3. **Reveal and Discuss** (5-10 minutes)
   - Show estimates simultaneously
   - Discuss reasoning, especially outliers
   - Address questions and concerns

4. **Re-estimate** (2 minutes)
   - Second round of private estimation
   - Repeat until consensus reached

5. **Document** (2 minutes)
   - Record final estimate with rationale
   - Note any assumptions or risks

### 3. Sprint Planning
**Responsible**: Scrum Master, Development Team, Product Owner
**Duration**: Sprint Planning meeting

**Activities**:
- Select estimated stories for sprint
- Verify team capacity
- Confirm story point commitment
- Assign initial owners

**Entry Criteria**:
- Stories are estimated and refined
- Team velocity is known
- Sprint capacity calculated

**Exit Criteria**:
- Sprint backlog committed
- Stories assigned to team members
- Sprint goal defined

#### Capacity Planning Guidelines
- Use 80% of average velocity for planning
- Account for team member availability
- Reserve 20% for unplanned work and bugs
- Balance story sizes within sprint

### 4. Development Workflow
**Responsible**: Development Team
**Duration**: Throughout sprint

#### 4.1 Story Start
**Activities**:
- Move story to "In Progress"
- Create feature branch
- Review acceptance criteria
- Set up development environment

**Definition of Ready**:
- [ ] Story points estimated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Dependencies resolved
- [ ] Technical approach agreed

#### 4.2 Implementation
**Activities**:
- Implement functionality
- Write unit tests
- Update documentation
- Self-review code

**Best Practices**:
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Follow coding standards
- Maintain test coverage >80%
- Update story status regularly

#### 4.3 Code Review
**Activities**:
- Create pull/merge request
- Assign reviewers
- Address feedback
- Ensure CI/CD passes

**Review Criteria**:
- [ ] Code follows standards
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed

### 5. Testing and Validation
**Responsible**: QA Team, Development Team
**Duration**: Concurrent with development

**Activities**:
- Execute test cases
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Perform regression testing
- Document defects if found

**Entry Criteria**:
- Code review approved
- Feature deployed to test environment
- Test cases prepared

**Exit Criteria**:
- All acceptance criteria validated
- No critical or high-priority defects
- Regression tests passing

### 6. Story Completion
**Responsible**: Product Owner, Development Team
**Duration**: End of sprint or upon completion

**Activities**:
- Demonstrate functionality
- Get Product Owner acceptance
- Deploy to production
- Update documentation

**Definition of Done Verification**:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Product Owner approval

## Workflow Variations by Story Type

### Bug Fix Workflow
```
[Bug Report] → [Triage] → [Estimated] → [Fix] → [Verify] → [Closed]
```

**Special Considerations**:
- Immediate triage for critical bugs
- Root cause analysis required
- Regression tests mandatory
- Customer notification if applicable

### Technical Task Workflow
```
[Technical Need] → [Spike/Research] → [Estimated] → [Implementation] → [Validation] → [Done]
```

**Special Considerations**:
- May require research spike first
- Technical review with architecture team
- Performance benchmarking required
- Impact assessment documented

### Epic Workflow
```
[Epic Creation] → [Story Breakdown] → [Estimation] → [Sprint Planning] → [Execution] → [Epic Closure]
```

**Special Considerations**:
- Break into user stories first
- Track epic progress across sprints
- Regular stakeholder updates
- Success metrics validation

## Escalation Procedures

### Estimation Disputes
1. **Team Discussion**: Allow 10 minutes for consensus building
2. **Product Owner Input**: Clarify requirements or priorities
3. **Technical Lead Decision**: Make final call on estimates
4. **Document Decision**: Record rationale for future reference

### Blocked Stories
1. **Immediate Action**: Team member identifies and reports blocker
2. **Scrum Master Support**: Help resolve dependency or impediment
3. **Escalation**: Involve Product Owner or management if needed
4. **Alternative Planning**: Swap with other ready stories if possible

### Scope Changes
1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate effect on current estimate
2. **Re-estimation**: Conduct new Planning Poker session if needed
3. **Product Owner Decision**: Accept change or defer to next sprint
4. **Documentation**: Update story with new requirements and estimate

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Estimation Accuracy**: Variance between estimated and actual effort
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from start to completion
- **Throughput**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Velocity Trend**: Team velocity over time
- **Quality**: Defects per story point delivered

### Tracking Methods
- Daily standups for progress updates
- Sprint review for completed work
- Retrospectives for process improvement
- Velocity charts for trend analysis
